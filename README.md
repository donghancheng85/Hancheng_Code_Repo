# Hancheng_Code_Repo
Sandbox for rapid prototyping. Developing code to demonstrate algorithms, data structures, design patterns and concurrency.

Almost all the code in this repo is developed by myself.

Most of the code has been checked by clang-tidy (static code checking) and gcc sanitizer (dynamic code checking). 

The CMake template that I am using for my development work can be found at this link: https://github.com/donghancheng85/CppProjectTemplate_GTest
